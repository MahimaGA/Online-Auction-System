## Features üåü

- **Real-Time Bidding**: Participants can place bids in real-time, enhancing the auction experience.
- **Modular Deployment**: The system supports modular architecture, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
- **Concurrency Control**: Handles multiple users and bids simultaneously without conflicts.
- **In-Memory Data Management**: Ensures fast data access and processing for a smooth user experience.
- **WebSocket Support**: Provides live updates to users, making the auction dynamic and engaging.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Java EE (J2EE)**: The core framework for building enterprise applications.
- **Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)**: Manages business logic and transaction handling.
- **Java Message Service (JMS)**: Facilitates communication between distributed components.
- **Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)**: Manages the lifecycle of components and their dependencies.
- **WebSocket**: Enables real-time communication between clients and the server.

- **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes a connection for real-time updates.

### 2. Server-Side
- **EJB Layer**: Contains business logic and transaction management.
- **JMS Layer**: Manages message queues for communication between components.
- **CDI Layer**: Handles dependency injection for seamless component interaction.

### 3. Database Layer
- **In-Memory Database**: Utilizes an in-memory database for fast data access and manipulation.

### 4. Communication Layer
- **WebSocket**: Provides a full-duplex communication channel for real-time updates.
